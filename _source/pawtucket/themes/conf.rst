Configuration Files
===================

The default theme contains a set of configuration files that will help you customize various areas of your Pawtucket installation, including detail pages, search, browse, and others.  The essential configuration files are preloaded with default values in themes/default/conf, and additional files are available in app/conf for more advanced configuration settings.

.. tip::
	Always copy a configuration file to your custom theme's conf folder before making changes, otherwise updates may overwrite your settings!
