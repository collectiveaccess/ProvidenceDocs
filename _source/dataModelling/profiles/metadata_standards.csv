`Dublin Core <http://www.dublincore.org/>`_,"The ""least common denominator"" format suitable for those experimenting with cataloguing strategies, or with simple cataloguing requirements.",Dublin Core is supported as a configuration profile for item-level (object) cataloguing. The profile set up includes fields as per the `Simple Dublin Core specification <http://www.dublincore.org/documents/dces/>`_ with a few extensions (ex. for uploaded media). Overhauled in 2014.,`Dublin Core profile on Github <https://github.com/collectiveaccess/providence/blob/master/install/profiles/xml/dublincore_2014.xml>`_
`DarwinCore <http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/>`_,"The Darwin Core standard was originally conceived to facilitate the discovery, retrieval, and integration of information about modern biological specimens, their spatiotemporal occurrence, and their supporting evidence housed in collections (physical or digital). The Darwin Core today is broader in scope and more versatile. It is meant to provide a stable standard reference for sharing information on biological diversity. As a glossary of terms, the Darwin Core is meant to provide stable semantic definitions with the goal of being maximally reusable in a variety of contexts.",,`DarwinCore profile on Github <https://github.com/collectiveaccess/providence/blob/master/install/profiles/xml/darwincore.xml>`_
`EBU Core <https://tech.ebu.ch/metadata>`_,"Based on Dublin Core, EBUCore is a minimum list of attributes to describe audio and video resources for a wide range of broadcasting applications including for archives, exchange and publication.",Available as a configuration profile compliant with the EBU Core Version 1.4 specification.,`EBU Core profile on Github <https://github.com/collectiveaccess/providence/blob/master/install/profiles/xml/ebucore.xml>`_
`PBCore <http://pbcore.org/>`_,"From PBCore.org:The PBCore (Public Broadcasting Metadata Dictionary) was created by the public broadcasting community in the United States of America for use by public broadcasters and related communities. Like EBUCore, the PBCore metadata specification is built on the foundation of Dublin Core, emphasizing the description of audio and video resources in production, archival, and broadcasting environments.","PBCore is supported as a configuration profile for item-level (instantiation/intellectual content) cataloguing, and as an export target.",`PBCore profile on Github <https://github.com/collectiveaccess/providence/blob/master/install/profiles/xml/pbcore.xml>`_
`CDWA-Lite <http://www.getty.edu/research/publications/electronic_publications/index.html>`_ / `CCO <http://cco.vrafoundation.org/>`_,"From the CDWA web site: CDWA Lite is an XML schema to describe core records for works of art and material culture based on the Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA) and Cataloging Cultural Objects: A Guide to Describing Cultural Works and Their Images (CCO). CA can be configured to implement the format of the XML schema in its relational database. (For those keeping score: CA does not store CDWA data in an XML format, but will be able to export data in such a format in the first version of the data export feature).","CDWA is supported as a configuration profile for item-level (object) and authority (entity, places, collections, etc.) cataloguing. An option to configure for the CDWA subset defined by Cataloguing Cultural Objects (CCO) is also provided. Will also be supported as a data export target format. This support is not yet fully implemented.",`CDWA profile on Github <https://github.com/collectiveaccess/providence/blob/master/install/profiles/xml/cdwalite.xml>`_
`EAD <http://www.loc.gov/ead/>`_,"EAD is widely used in the United States as a data standard for finding aids produced by archives, libraries, museums, and manuscript repositories.",EAD is supported as a data export target format.,
