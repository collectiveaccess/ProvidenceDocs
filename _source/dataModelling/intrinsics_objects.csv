Identifier,idno,The object identifier. Must follow policy defined in configured numbering policy if app.conf setting require_valid_id_number_for_ca_objects is set. Must be unique if  app.conf setting allow_duplicate_id_number_for_ca_objects is not set. ,Depends upon numbering policy,
Type,type_id,A value from the object_types list indicating the type of the record. Stored as an internally generated numeric item_id. When setting this value in a data import or via an API call the item identifier may be used.,,
Parent,parent_id,Reference to parent record. Will be null if no parent is defined. When setting this value in a data import or via an API call the  identifier of the parent object may be used.,No,null
Access,access,"Determines visibility of record in public-facing applications such as Pawtucket. Values are defined in the access_statuses list. Typically the list includes values for ""public"" and ""private"" visibility. For historical reasons the value stored in the intrinsic is the list item's `value` field, not its identifer or label. By convention ""0"" is interpreted as private and ""1"" as public access, although this can be modified or expanded in app.conf if required.",Yes,0
Status,status,"Records the general cataloguing workflow status of the record. Values are defined in the workflow_statuses list. For historical reasons the value stored in the intrinsic is the list item's `value` field, not its identifer or label. Unlike access values, statuses have no functional impact on a record. They are merely informations and intended to provide a simple, straightforward way to track the cataloguing process.",Yes,0
Lot,lot_id,"A reference to the lot record (ca_object_lots) of which the object is a part. May be null if the object is not part of a lot. Note that an object may be part of only one lot. The raw database value contained lot_id is an internally generated numeric lot_id. However, when setting this intrinsic via an import mapping or API call you may also use the lot's identifier.",No,
Source,source_id,A value from the object_sources list indicating the original source of the object. This value is sometimes used to broadly distinguish different classes of objects. When setting this value in a data import or via an API call the item identifier may be used.,No,
Deaccessioned?,is_deaccessioned,A flag indicating whether the object is deaccessioned. Will be 1 when deaccessioned or 0 (the default) when not deaccessioned.,Yes,0
Date of deaccession,deaccession_date,The date of deaccession. If unknown the value will be null. The date is stored as an historic daterange and may be any valid historic date (Eg. it is not limited to post-1970 dates).,No,
Date of disposal,deaccession_disposal_date,The date of disposal of the object. This is typically a date after deaccession. If unknown the value will be null. The date is stored as an historic daterange and may be any valid historic date (Eg. it is not limited to post-1970 dates).,No,
Deaccession notes,deaccession_notes,Any notes regarding the deaccession process. Limited to 65535 characters maximum length.,No,
Deaccession type,deaccession_type_id,"A value from the object_deaccession_types list indicated type of deaccession. Examples of deaccession types might include ""Sold"", ""Destroyed"" and ""Transferred"". When setting this value in a data import or via an API call the item identifier may be used.",No,
Acquisition type,acquisition_type_id,A value from the object_acq_types list indicating how the object was acquired. When setting this value in a data import or via an API call the item identifier may be used.,No,
Accession status,item_status_id,"A value from the object_statuses list indicating the accession status of the object. Accession status values might include ""accessioned"", ""pending accession"", ""non-accessioned item"", etc. When setting this value in a data import or via an API call the item identifier may be used.",No,
Extent,extent,"The numeric extent. Must a be a whole, positive number. Default is 0.",Yes,0
Units of extent,extent_units,"Units of extent value, as text.",Yes,
Library circulation status,circulation_status_id,"A value from the object_circulation_statuses list indicating the circulation status of the object, as set by the library check-in/out system. When setting this value in a data import or via an API call the item identifier may be used.",No,
Submitted by user,submission_user_id,"For records submitted via the Pawtucket ""contribute"" form interface. The user who submitted the record.",No,
Submission group,submission_group_id,"For records submitted via the Pawtucket ""contribute"" form interface. The group of the user that submitted the record.",No,
Submission status,submission_status_id,"For records submitted via the Pawtucket ""contribute"" form interface. A value from the submission_statuses list indicating the review status of the submitted record. When setting this value in a data import or via an API call the item identifier may be used.",No,
Submission form,submission_via_form,"For records submitted via the Pawtucket ""contribute"" form interface.  The identifying code of the form used to submit the record.",No,
View count,view_count,Number of times record has been viewed in Pawtucket front-end,No,0
Home location,home_location_value,"The home location of the object, formatted using the display template defined by the app.conf ""home_location_display_template"" directive an evaluated relative to the home ca_storage_locations record. If no template is defined in app.conf, the full hierarchical path of the home location is returned. The template may be overriden by passing a ""display_template"" tag option.",No,
