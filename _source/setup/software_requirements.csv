Software Package,Media Types,Notes
GraphicsMagick,Images,"Version 1.3.16 or better is required. GraphicsMagick is the preferred option for processing image files on all platforms and is better performing than any other option. Be sure to compile or obtain a version of GraphicsMagick with support for the formats you need. Support for some image formats is contingent upon other libraries being present on your server (eg. libTiff must be present for TIFF support]). Some less common formats, such as PSD, may require special configuration and/or compilation."
ImageMagick,Images,Version 6.5 or better is required. ImageMagick can handle more image formats than any other option but is significantly slower than GraphicsMagick in most situations. Be sure to compile or obtain a version of ImageMagick with support for the formats you need! Support for some image formats is contingent upon other libraries being present on your server (eg. libTiff must be present for TIFF support]).
libGD,Images,"A simple library for processing JPEG,  GIF and PNG format images,  GD is a fall-back for image processing when ImageMagick is not available. This library is typically bundled with PHP so you should not need to install it separately. In some cases you may need to perform a manual install or use a package provided by your operating system provider. In addition to supporting a limited set of image formats,  GD is typically slows than ImageMagick or GraphicsMagick for many operations. If at all possible install GraphicsMagick on your server."
ffmpeg,"Audio, Video",Required if you want to handle video or audio media. Be sure to compile to support the file formats and codecs you require.
Ghostscript,PDF Documents,"Ghostscript 9 or better is required to generate preview images of uploaded PDF documents. PDF uploads will still work,  but without preview images,  if Ghostscript is not installed. "
dcraw,Images,"Required to support upload of proprietary CameraRAW formats produced by various higher-end digital cameras. Note that that AdobeDNG format,  a newer RAW format,  is supported by GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick."
PdfToText,PDF Documents,"A utility to extract text from uploaded PDF files. If present CA will use PdfToText to extract text for indexing. If PdfToText is not installed on your server CA will not be able to search the content of uploaded PDF documents. This utility is part of the xpdf package available on some versions of Linux. In later Linux distribution versions, this utility is part of the Poppler package."
PdfMiner,PDF Documents,A utility to extract text and text locations from uploaded PDF files. If present CA will use PdfMiner to extract text for indexing and locations to support highlighting of search results during PDF display. If PdfMiner is not installed on your server CA will fall back to PdfToText for indexing and highlighting of search results will be disabled.
MediaInfo,"Images, Audio, Video, PDF Documents","A library for extraction of technical metadata from various audio and video file formats. If present CA can use MediaInfo to extract technical metadata,  otherwise it will fall back to using various built-in methods such as GetID3."
ExifTool,Images,A library for extraction of embedded metadata from many image file formats. If present CA can use it to extract metadata for display and import.
WkHTMLToPDF,PDF Output,"WkHTMLToPDF is an application that can perform high quality conversion of HTML code to PDF files. If present CollectiveAccess can use WkHTMLToPDF to generate PDF-format labels and reports. Version 0.12.1 is supported. Do not use version 0.12.2,  which has bugs that prevent valid formatting of output. If WkHTMLToPDF is not installed CollectiveAccess will fall back to a slower built-in alternative."
