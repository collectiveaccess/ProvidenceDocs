Block Key,Description
intrinsic_fields,"Simple list of key-value pairs. The key is the field name. If a mandatory field is missing or if a field value is invalid, you will get an appropriate error message."
preferred_labels,"List of JSON objects each describing one preferred label. Note that there can only be one preferred label per locale. The ""locale"" key is mandatory and should contain the locale code used for this label. The other keys depend on the label fields of the table you want to insert the record in. ca_object_labels for instance only has a single ""name"" field while ca_entity_labels has ""forename"",""middlename"",""surname"",""displayname"" and more."
"nonpreferred_labels	","Same as preferred_labels except that multiple labels per locale are allowed. Also, there is an optional ""type_id"" parameter that can be used to specify the type of the label."
attributes,"A list of key => list of values mappings. Depending on your configuration, elements can be repeatable and therefore take multiple values. Key is the element_code of the element you want to use to create the attributes. Each of the values can have a ""locale"" value (depending on the element configuration it might be mandatory). Furthermore, each pair in a single value definition consists the element_code of an element in the current set (the key) and the corresponding value. If the top element is not nested (i.e. a ""Container""), there is only one element in the set (see the ""notes"" element in the example gist). If there are multiple elements in the set (i.e. the top element is a Container), it doesn't matter how deeply nested the structure of the element, it's all a flat namespace - which means all sub-elements can be set in a simple list as can be seen in the GitHub gist example (element ""address"")."
related,"A list of relationship instances, grouped by name of the related table. For each instance, the primary key of the related record and the type_id (which refers to the relationship type used for this relationship instance) are mandatory. ""effective_date"" and ""source_info"" are optional keys."
