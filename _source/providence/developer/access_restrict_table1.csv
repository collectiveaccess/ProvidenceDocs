actions,A list of user actions as defined in the user_actions.conf configuration file,An empty list
operator,Boolean operator that is used to connect the actions. AND means a user has to have a role with all listed actions; OR means having one of the listed actions is sufficient for access. Can be left empty (defaults to AND).,AND
parameters,An optional array that describes parameter values that must be valid before this rule is applied (otherwise it is simply ignored). This is useful if you want to distinguish between editing existing records and the creation of new ones. In this case you would have two rules: One that applies if the primary key value passed does not equal zero (i.e. the user is editing an existing value) and another one that applies only if the value is zero (i.e. a new record is created). For the exact format of the array please have a look at the example below. Note that we have to know the type of the parameter in advance to perform all checks correctly. You can also set the name of the parameter to type and set the value to a type code/idno (i.e. ca_list_items.idno). The rule then only applied if the subject has the given type. Please have a look at the last example below if you plan to use this feature.,An empty array
