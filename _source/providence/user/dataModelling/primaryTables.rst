Primary Tables and Intrinsic Fields
===================================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1

CollectiveAccess is structured around several primary tables, with editors that can be enabled (or disabled) depending on project requirements. Each primary table has intrinsic bundles and its own set of preferred and non-preferred labels bundles. Distinct user interfaces can be configured for each table, and within that, a single table can have multiple user interfaces restricted by Type (see Types). 

Editors that are not relevant for your system (you don't catalogue places for example) can be disabled in the configuration file app.conf, by setting the various \*_disable directives below to a non-zero value

Here's how it looks in app.conf:

.. code-block:: none

	# Editor "disable" switches
	# -------------------
	ca_objects_disable = 0
	ca_entities_disable = 0
	ca_places_disable = 0
	ca_occurrences_disable = 0
	ca_collections_disable = 0
	ca_object_lots_disable = 0
	ca_storage_locations_disable = 0
	ca_loans_disable = 0
	ca_movements_disable = 1
	ca_tours_disable = 1
	ca_tour_stops_disable = 1
	ca_object_representations_disable = 1

Objects (ca_objects)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Object records represent items or assets in a collection, typically the physical or born-digital items being managed. Every object record has a "type" that determines which fields are relevant for it. The list of types available in your system can be customized to match your specific cataloging requirements.

Object intrinsics (ca_objects)
******************************

.. csv-table::
   :widths: 15, 25, 40, 5, 5
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: intrinsics_objects.csv   	

`Note:` ca_objects.preferred_labels.name is used by data mappings and display templates to reference the intrinsic name field in the ca_object_labels table

Object Lots (ca_object_lots)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Lots record the accession or acquisition of one or more objects. Lots are commonly used by collecting institutions who may accession more than one unique item per accession. Registrarial information, such as the Deed of Gift, may be recorded in a lot record while  cataloging for each accessioned object remains at the object level.

`Note:` ca_object_lots.preferred_labels.name is used by data mappings and display templates to reference the intrinsic name field in the ca_object_lot_labels table

Entities (ca_entities)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Entity records represent specific people and organizations. Relationships can be created between entity and object records (or any other records in any other table) with fully customizable relationship types. For example, an entity record for an individual could be related to an object record as the creator of the object, or the photographer, donor, publisher, performer, etc.

Entity intrinsics (ca_entities)

Places (ca_places)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Place records represent physical locations, geographic or otherwise. Places are inherently hierarchical allowing you to nest more specific place records within broader ones. As with entities, places can be related records in other tables. Places are typically used to model location authorities specific to your system. For cataloguing of common geographical place names consider using CollectiveAccess' built-in support for GoogleMaps, OpenStreetMap, GeoNames and/or the Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN).

`Note:` ca_places.preferred_labels.name is used by data mappings and display templates to reference the intrinsic name field in the ca_place_labels table

Occurrences (ca_occurrences)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Occurrences are used to represent temporal concepts such as events, exhibition, productions or citations. 

Occurrence intrinsics (ca_occurrences)
**************************************

.. csv-table::
   :widths: 20, 15, 40, 10, 10
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: intrinsics_occurrences.csv

`Note:` ca_occurrences.preferred_labels.name is used by data mappings and display templates to reference the intrinsic name field in the ca_occurrence_labels table

Collections (ca_collections)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Collections represent significant groupings of objects. They may refer to physical collections, symbolic collections of items associated by some criteria, or any other grouping. Collection records are often used to manage formal archival processing and the creation of finding aids, by configuring records to be compliant with the Describing Archives (DACS) content standard.

`Note:` ca_collections.preferred_labels.name is used by data mappings and display templates to reference the intrinsic name field in the ca_collection_labels table

Collection intrinsics (ca_collections)
**************************************

.. csv-table::
   :widths: 20, 15, 40, 10, 10
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: intrinsics_collections.csv
   
Storage Locations (ca_storage_locations)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Storage location records represent physical locations where objects may be located, displayed or stored. Like place records, storage locations are hierarchical and may be nested to allow notation location at various levels of specificity (building, room, cabinet, drawer, etc.). As with the other primary tables, each storage location may have arbitrarily rich cataloguing, including access restrictions, geographical coordinates, keywords and other information. 

Storage location intrinsics (ca_storage_locations)
**************************************************

.. csv-table::
   :widths: 20, 15, 40, 10, 10

`Note:` ca_storage_locations.preferred_labels.name is used by data mappings and display templates to reference the intrinsic name field in the ca_storage_location_labels table

Loans (ca_loans)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Loan records record details of both incoming and outgoing loans of objects. Loan records, like those in all other tables, is fully customizable and can be used to track alls aspects of a loan, including dates, shipping, and insurance information. 

Loan intrinsics (ca_loans)

   :file: intrinsics_loans.csv

`Note:` ca_loans.preferred_labels.name is used by data mappings and display templates to reference the intrinsic name field in the ca_loan_labels table

Movements (ca_movements)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
For more complex location tracking needs, movement records can be used to record in precise detail movement of objects between storage locations, while on loan or while on exhibition. Used as part of a location tracking or use history policy, movements can provide a robust record of every movement event in an object's history.

Movements intrinsics (ca_movements)

Object Representations (ca_object_representations)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Representations capture representative digital media (images, video, audio, PDFs) for objects. Representation records usually contain only just a media file, but can accommodate  additional cataloguing that is specific to the media file (not to the object the file depicts or represents) if desired. When used. representation metadata often includes captions, credits, access information, rights and reproduction restrictions.

Object representation intrinsics (ca_object_representations)

`Note:` ca_object_representations.preferred_labels.name is used by data mappings and display templates to reference the intrinsic name field in the ca_object_representation_labels table

Tours (ca_tours)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Tour records capture information about on-site or online tours of objects, locations, collections or any other record in the database.

.. csv-table::
   :widths: 20, 15, 40, 10, 10
   :header-rows: 1

`Note:` ca_tours.preferred_labels.name is used by data mappings and display templates to reference the intrinsic name field in the ca_tour_labels table

Tour Stops (ca_tour_stops)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each tour record has any number of ordered "stops". Each tour stop contains metadata about the stop (descriptive text, geographic coordinates, etc.) as well as relationships to relevant objects, entities and more.

Tour stop intrinsics (ca_tour_stops)
************************************

.. csv-table::
   :widths: 20, 15, 40, 10, 10

.. note:: ca_tour_stops.preferred_labels.name is used by data mappings and display templates to reference the intrinsic name field in the ca_tour_stop_labels table


Label Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^ 
Labels are record names or titles. All primary tables have companion label tables. Labels come in two varieties: preferred and non-preferred. Each record has one, and only one, preferred label. The preferred label is used as the record’s default display title. Records may have any number of non-preferred labels, which are taken as alternative titles and may be used in searches. Labels are always present and do not need to be configured to exist.

The following shorthand is commonly used to reference preferred labels: <tablename>.preferred_labels.<label table name field>.  For example the following would display an object preferred label:

.. code-block:: none

	ca_objects.preferred_labels.name

See label name fields below for table specific name fields.


Label Table Intrinsics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Occassionally label table names and intrinsic fields need to be referenced directly, for example while configuring searching indexing.  Search indexing in `Search_indexing.conf <file:///Users/charlotteposever/Documents/ca_manual/providence/user/configuration/mainConfiguration/search_indexing.html>`_.

.. note:: 
	<table name>.preferred_labels.<name of intrinsic> is used by data mappings and display templates to reference the intrinsic _name_ field for preferred labels. The _<table name>.preferred_labels_ construct is simply an alias for the label table, filtered to return only those entries with the _is_preferred_  set. For example _ca_objects.preferred_labels.name_ and _ca_object_labels.name_ refer to the same thing, except that the _ca_object_labels.name_ version will return _all_ labels, while _ca_objects.preferred_labels.name_ will return only those marked as preferred. Similarly,  _<table name>.nonpreferred_labels.<name of intrinsic>_ will return all entries _not_ marked as preferred. Whether you use _ca_objects.preferred_labels.<name of intrinsic>_, ca_objects.nonpreferred_labels.<name of intrinsic>_ or _ca_object_labels.<name of intrinsic>_, the intrinsic names used are the same ones listed below.

There can only be one preferred label per item per locale. That is, if you are cataloguing in three languages you can have up to three preferred labels, one in each language. Non-preferred labels are alternative names that can be used to enhance searching or preserve identity. Non-preferred labels can repeat without limit, take locales and optionally take type values which may be employed distinguish valid 'alternate' labels from simple search enhancing non-preferred labels."
