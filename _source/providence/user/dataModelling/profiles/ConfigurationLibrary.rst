Configuration Library
=====================

Listed below are a selection of user-contributed installation profiles. Some are based on standards and some are completely custom; all were designed to meet the functional requirements of real-world projects. Even if none of the profiles in the library can be used "out-of-the-box" for your project, some may provide development ideas and useful points of departure for your own profile. Before attempting to decipher the profiles presented here be sure to familiarize yourself with the profile syntax, as described in the Building System Installation Profiles manual.

Note that the profiles listed here are not intended as exemplars of "good design." Many employ sub-optimal metadata and user interface structures in order to accommodate various legacy and project-specific requirements. They are presented merely as examples of how previous users have approached systems design for their particular discipline. Your mileage may vary.

To use a profile listed here with your copy of CollectiveAccess, download the desired profile and copy it into the **profiles/xml** directory of the installer (Eg. /install/profiles/xml). After reloading the installer start page, the newly installed profile should appear in the profiles drop-down menu.
