Attribute types represent all of the different varieties of fields supported by CollectiveAccess. Each one is slightly different because each is designed to accept and normalized data in different formats. See below for more details about the unique nature of each Attribute type. The full list of attribute types is listed `here <https://github.com/collectiveaccess/providence/blob/master/app/conf/attribute_types.conf>`_.
