Engine,Description,URL,Notes
domPDF,"A rendering engine implemented entirely in PHP. Its main advantage is that it requires no additional installation or special software. If CA can run then domPDF will be available. Primary downsides are performance and render quality, both of which can be unacceptably terrible as your output grows in size and/or complexity. Rendering times for domPDF often grow exponentially with respect to document size, making long document output (dozens of pages) potentially problematic.",http://dompdf.github.io,
wkhtmltopdf,"The WebKit rendering engine that drives the Chrome and Safari web browsers packaged as a server-side HTML/CSS to PDF converter. Advantages are speed and render quality. It is generally 2-100 times faster than domPDF and can handle more complex documents accurately. Downsides are the need to install wkhtmltopdf software on your server, the lack of support for it on most shared servers and incompatibility of some versions with CA (see notes).",http://wkhtmltopdf.org,"Scaling of output in the current version, 0.12.2, is broken resulting in output that cannot be accurately printed. Use version 0.12.1 instead."
phantomjs,"Another WebKit-based HTML/CSS to PDF converter. It has the same installation, performance and quality advantages and disadvantages over domPDF as wkhtmltopdf. NOTE: This engine is deprecated and no longer actively supported. PhantomJS code will be stripped from version 1.8",http://phantomjs.org,
