MEDIAN,"Apply a median filter to the image, of the given radius.",".. code-block:: text

  MEDIAN { radius = 2 }

SHARPEN,"Use a Gaussian operator of the given radius and standard deviation (sigma).
For reasonable results, radius should be larger than sigma.
Use a radius of 0 to have the method select a suitable radius.

The parameters are:

* **radius**: The radius of the Gaussian, in pixels, not counting the center pixel (default 0).
* **sigma**: The standard deviation of the Gaussian, in pixels (default 1.0).
  It can be any floating point value from 0.1, for practically no sharpening, to
3 or more for sever sharpening. 0.5 to 1.0 is rather good.

The larger the sigma the more it sharpens.

* ``sharpen 0x.4``: 	very small
* ``sharpen 0x1.0``:	about one pixel size sharpen
* ``sharpen 0x3.0``:	probably getting too large

UNSHARPEN_MASK,"
This filter sharpens an image. The image is convolved with a Gaussian operator of the
given radius and standard deviation (sigma).
For reasonable results, radius should be larger than sigma.
Use a radius of 0 to have the method select a suitable radius.

The parameters are:

* **radius**: The radius of the Gaussian, in pixels, not counting the center pixel (default 0).
* **sigma**: The standard deviation of the Gaussian, in pixels (default 1.0).
* **amount**: The fraction of the difference between the original and the blur image that is added back into the original (default 1.0).
* **threshold**: The threshold, as a fraction of QuantumRange, needed to apply the difference amount (default 0.05).
