restrict_to_types,An optional list of types *for the item you are browsing by* to restrict the facet to. The types can be internal item_ids for the types or ca_list_item.idno values (eg. list item codes set by the installation profile). This key lets you set up facets that only browse a subset of a given authority: only places of type 'river' for instance.,No
restrict_to_relationship_types,An optional list of relationship types to restrict the facet to. The types can be internal relationship type_ids for the relationship types or alphanumeric type codes (eg. type codes set by the installation profile).

exclude_relationship_types,An optional list of relationship types to exclude from the facet. The types can be internal relationship type_ids for the relationship types or alphanumeric type codes (eg. type codes set by the installation profile). This key lets you set up facets that only browse a subset of a given authority: only places linked to objects with relation types other than 'depicts'),No
generate_facets_for_types,"If set to a non-zero value, will cause the current facet to be automatically converted into a separate facet for each type of the item type being browsed by.

show_all_when_first_facet,"If set to a non-zero value, will force this facet to include all items in the authority whether than are related to the underlying browse table or not when the browse has no criteria set (ie. when the facet is the first one chosen in the browse). Default is false.",No

show_hierarchy,Set to non-zero value to display hierarchy on items in this facet; default is to not display hierarchy,No
hierarchical_delimiter,Character(s) to place between elements of the hierarchy,No
