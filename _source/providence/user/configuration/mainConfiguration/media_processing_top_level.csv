use_external_url_when_available,"If you want original media fetched from URLs to *NOT* be stored in CA, but rather for CA to directly reference the media via the URL used to fetch it set use_external_url_when_available to 1.
If you have no idea what this means then leave this set to zero.",0
queue_threshold_in_bytes,"Filesize (in bytes) above which media should be queued for background processing
Files smaller than the threshold will be processed at the time of upload, so you should set this to a
small enough value that your server has a shot at processing the media in near-realtime. A safe bet is
500,000 bytes (eg. 0.5 megabytes), but you may need to go lower (or higher).

Note that you can override this setting for specific media types and versions below if you wish. Also keep in
mind a few other fun facts:

1. If the queue_enabled setting in global.conf is set to zero then no background processing will take place, no matter what you set here.
2. The default setting for queue_enabled is zero, so make sure you change it if you want background processing to happen.
3. Versions that have no QUEUE_WHEN_FILE_LARGER_THAN are never queued for background processing; versions with a QUEUE_WHEN_FILE_LARGER_THAN settings of zero are similarly never queued (absence and zero are one and the same, config-wise).
4. Some types of media are setup by default to never queue no matter the ""queue_threshold_in_bytes"" and ""queue_enabled"" settings. This includes media types for much little or no processing is done, including SWF, XML and MSWord.
