The Annotation Editor allows users to create and annotate clips for audio and video files. The Annotation Editor allows users to create and annotate clips for audio and video. These are useful for marking specific timestamps in an audio or video recording, and annotating with text.

The Annotation Editor is only available in CollectiveAccess for audio recordings, videos, or other audiovisual media. 

Creating Annotations
--------------------

To create an annotation, media must already be uploaded into CollectiveAccess. To open the Annotation Editor, navigate to any audio/video record. 

Select the Media tab on the left side of the recordâ€™s screen:

   :align: center

   The media tab of a record in CollectiveAccess, which shows the media representation and other metadata. 

From this tab, a number of options are available to the right, within the Media representations field. These include: 

* **Is primary**: Set the media representation as the primary display image. This is helpful if multiple images, or other media files are associated with a single object.

* **Full record**: Displays the record for the media file. 

* **Annotations**: Opens the Annotations editor. 

* **Metadata**: Displays the extracted metadata from the media file. 

* **Download**: Downloads the media file. 


From here, select **Annotations.**

Another screen will be displayed:

   The Annotation editor screen.

Note at the top left of the screen, there are **0 clips.** Once clips are created, they will appear at the top of the screen. 

Creating Clips to Annotate 
--------------------------

To create clips to annotate on the Annotation Editor screen, select **start** to the right of the plus icon. |plus|

This will automatically play the audio or video. Select **end** to the right of the plus icon |end| to end the clip. 

.. |end| image:: end.png
          :scale: 50%

This will set both start and endpoints for each annotated clip, whose timestmamps will appear in the metadata. Supply metadata for each annotation by filling out the fields to the right of the audio or video. Like all editors in CollectiveAccess, the annotation form can be customized with any metadata elements or relationship bundles (to entities, places, etc.) The default configuration includes Title and Annotation Properties (Start and End time codes). To customize the form, go to Manage-Administration-User Interfaces and open the "representation annotations" editor. Follow the link for more information on UI customization.

.. note:: Annotations will only become available once a start and endpoint has been selected. Then, the metadata can be customized and the annotated clip created and saved. 

Once the start and endpoints, and metadata, have been selected and filled out, select **save annotation.** Saved annotations will appear horizontally at the top of the editor in the carousel. From there they can be opened for further editing, or deleted.
