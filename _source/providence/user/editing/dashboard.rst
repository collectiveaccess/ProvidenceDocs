CollectiveAccess provides a customizable **dashboard.** The dashboard is the home screen that displays upon login to any back-end system (Providence). 

The main function of the Dashboard is to display the widgets for your system. **Widgets** provide specialized functions, and serve as mini-applications within Providence. The number of widgets in the Dashboard is entirely configurable, and their arrangement is customizable to suit a variety of collections and workflows. Every CollectiveAccess system comes with a specific set of widgets; however, custom widgets can be created, and widgets can be added or taken away from any dashboard. 

.. note:: Widgets can be written and created by any developer. For more on writing widgets, see `Writing Dashboard Widgets <file:///Users/charlotteposever/Documents/ca_manual/providence/developer/writing_dash_widgets.html?highlight=widget>`_. 

Adding Widgets to the Dashboard

The position of widgets on the Dashboard can be configured. Once widgets have been selected and added, they will display on the Dashboard. 

To change the location of widgets on the home screen, simply **select and drag** the widget around on the Dashboard. **Drop** the widget in the desired location. 

Once widgets have been configured, select **Done** in the upper right of the screen above the widget instructions. 

Widget Settings
---------------

While still editing the Dashboard, specific settings can be viewed and configured for each widget. To do so, select the **i** icon |icon| located in the top right corner of each widget.

For each widget, different settings will be displayed that can be customized. For example, the Counts widget on the Dashboard appears like this:

.. image:: dashboard8.png
   :scale: 50%
   :align: center

When the **i** icon |icon| is selected, these settings appear that can be customized: 

.. |icon| image:: dashboard6.png
          :scale: 50%

.. image:: dashboard9.png

Select or de-select these settings to change the contents that appear in the widget upon login.
