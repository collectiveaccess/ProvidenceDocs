Batch Editing
=====================

CollectiveAccess supports features for making uniform changes to batches of data, saving time and effort when editing records of any type. Batch Editing in CollectiveAccess organizes records into groups, which can then be edited simultaneously; a single edit can be applied to several records at once. Batch edits are commonly performed via Sets, groups of records that can be created to aid your work in a variety of ways. 

Before beginning a Batch Edit, check the settings in Preferences. In most cases, the default setting is the best, or only, option available. However, in some cases, there are alternate settings which can limit the fields appearing on the batch editing screen.

There are two ways to effectively Batch Edit records in CollectiveAccess:

1. Batch editing using **sets**
2. Batch editing sets using **search results**

In order to batch-edit records, a set must be created and defined. For more on creating a Set and options for Sets, see `Sets <file:///Users/charlotteposever/Documents/ca_manual/providence/user/workflow/sets.html>`_.

Once a Set is established, a batch edit can be executed from the My Sets screen. Navigate to Manage > My Sets, and select the icon in the **# Items** |icon| column.

Selecting this icon will open the batch-editing interface, where a list of fields is displayed. These fields are all of the metadata elements from that record type's Basic Info screen:
