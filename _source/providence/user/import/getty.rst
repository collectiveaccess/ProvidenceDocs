**Getty Vocabularies**

**Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT)**
==============================================
CollectiveAccess also supports standardized and local controlled vocabularies which can be incorporated into any CollectiveAccess system. The `Getty Art and Architecture Thesaurus <https://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/>`_ is a controlled authority that maintains consistency in terms, and defines links and relationships between terms. The AAT contains terminologies and concepts specifically relating to art, art history, material culture, and architecture.

Specific, relevant vocabulary terms can be directly linked to records and vocabulary data in CollectiveAccess. These terms can also be used to enhance retrieval in searches within a system. Vocabularies in CollectiveAccess are treated as Lists and are controlled through the Lists and Vocabulary Manager in any given database.
