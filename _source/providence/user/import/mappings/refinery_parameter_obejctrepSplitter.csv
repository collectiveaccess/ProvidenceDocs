Type of Refinery Parameter,Parameter Notes,Example
objectRepresentationType,"Sets the object representation type to ""front"" or ""back.""","{""objectRepresentationType"": ""front""}"
attributes,"Sets the attributes for the object representation. ""Media"" sets the source of the media filename in the data, which is what will match on the actual media file in the import directory. Note: filenames in source data may or may not the include file extension, but source data must match filename exactly. Set the media filename to idno, using ""idno"". Additional attributes, such as the example, ""internal_notes"", can also be set here.","{ ""attributes"":
   {
       ""media"": ""^1"",
       ""internal_notes"": ""^2"",
       ""idno"": ""^1""
   }
}"
mediaPrefix,"Set the directory containing the media to be matched on here. In the following example, the import directory contains a folder named tiff/.","{""mediaPrefix"": ""tiff/""}"
matchOn,"From version 1.5. Defines exactly how the splitter will establish matches with pre-existing records. You can set the splitter to match on idno, or labels. You can also include both labels and idno in the matchOn parameter, and it will try multiple matches in the order specified.","{“matchOn”: [“labels”, “idno”]} -Will try to match on labels first, then idno.
{“matchOn”: [“idno”, “labels”]} - Will do the opposite, first idno and then labels.
You can also limit matching by doing one or the other. Eg:
{“matchOn”: [“idno”]} will only match on idno.
{""matchOn"": [""^ca_object_representations.your_custom_code""]} will match on a custom metadata element in the representation record. Use the syntax ^ca_object_representations.metadataElement code."
dontCreate,From version 1.5. If set to true (or any non-zero value) the splitter will only do matching and will not create new records when matches are not found.,"{""dontCreate"": ""1""}"
