**Color Coding the Inspector**
==============================

CollectiveAccess supports the customization of both the look and feel of any cataloging interface. Assigning custom colors and icons to the Inspector window of any record type or record subtype can streamline workflow, as well as ensure clear differentiation and generate easy to identify parts of any Editor screen. 

Unique colors can be assigned for the main Editors for record types which will extend to all subtypes in the system. Colors can also be assigned to the individual subtypes. If no custom color is assigned, the default color will automatically be assigned. 

These changes can be made directly in the user interface of any CollectiveAccess system.

Editor screen colors can be customized through the user interface. To customize the Inspector window in an editor screen: 

1. Navigate to **Manage > Administration** in the Global Navigation bar. This opens the list of available editor screens:
