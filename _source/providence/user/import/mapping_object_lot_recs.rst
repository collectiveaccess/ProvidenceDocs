Mapping Object Lot Records
==========================

Unlike mapping other records, mapping Object Lots requires some specifications in order for the import to create separate and related lot records.  

Firstly, to create separate and related object lot records from a table **other than** ca_object_lots, the Refinery **objectLotSplitter** is needed in the Refinery column of the import mapping spreadsheet. Since Refineries require Refinery Parameters, a Parameter is needed to define various aspects about the lot records. 

Object Lots require more than just a label and a type defined in the Refinery Parameter column. Lots also have a non-optional **lot_status_id** value, taken from the Object Lot Statuses list in CollectiveAccess (see `Using Lists and Vocabularies in an Import Mapping Spreadsheet <file:///Users/charlotteposever/Documents/ca_manual/providence/user/import/lists_and_vocab_in_mapping.html?highlight=using+lists>`_). The **lot_status_id** must be set to a valid status value, or the lot will fail to insert during import. 

In addition, the **ca_table.element_code** (Column 3 in the import mapping spreadsheet) must be set to **ca_objects.lot_id.** ID Numbers for ca_object_lots donâ€™t map to the normal idno, but rather **ca_object_lots.idno_stub.**

For more on Object Lots and their required or optional codes, see `Primary Tables and Intrinsic Fields <file:///Users/charlotteposever/Documents/ca_manual/providence/user/dataModelling/primaryTables.html?highlight=primary+tables#object-lots-ca-object-lots>`_. 

How to Map Object Lots
----------------------

The Sample Import Mapping Spreadsheet (:download:`Sample Import Mapping Spreadsheet <sample_mapping_tutorial.xlsx>`) maps object lot records that will be created and related to the objects being imported. These records are present in the Sample Import Data (Source Data) (:download:`Sample Import Data (Source Data) <sample_import_data_tutorial.xlsx>`) in columns 8 and 9, showing the type of Accessions, and the Accession numbers, of the objects to be imported:

   :align: center

To map these lots, set the **Source column** (Column 2 in the import mapping spreadsheet) to the column numbers present in the source data, similarly to how other columns are mapped.

The **CA table.element column** (Column 3 in the import mapping spreadsheet, Column 8 in the Source Data) must be set to **ca_objects.lot_id**, as seen in the Sample mapping below:

In this example, column 9 is skipped. In Column 6, use the Refinery ObjectLotSplitter. In Column 7, use a Refinery Parameter to specify how the Object Lot records will be imported in CollectiveAccess. 

The objectLotSplitter for Mapping Object Lots
----------------------------------------------

In order to create new and related lot records, the use of the **objectLotSplitter** refinery is necessary, as seen in the sample import mapping:

   :scale: 50%

Within the Refinery Parameter, note that attributes of the parameter contain references to object lot fields in CollectiveAccess. For lots, it is important to only map **ca_objects.lot_id** and **ca_object_lots.lot_status_id** in the mapping itself. Other object lot fields are referenced in the parameter and are pulled from the source data.

Within the Parameter, the **objectLotType** comes from Lists and Vocabularies in CollectiveAccess, **idno_stub** is pulling the lot idnos from column 9 of the source data, and the **lot_status_id** also comes from Lists and Vocabularies in CollectiveAccess.
