**Chenhall Nomenclature for Museum Cataloging**
===========================================
CollectiveAccess supports `Chenhall Nomenclature for Museum Cataloging <https://www.nomenclature.info/apropos-about.app?lang=en#Heading-About>`_, a standardized vocabulary popular for use in museums and historical societies throughout English- and French-speaking North America. 

Chenhall Nomenclature is a structured and controlled vocabulary that is primarily used to describe and catalog historical and ethnological collections. It is geographically and materially more specific than other supported vocabularies in Collective Access. Relevant vocabulary terms can be directly linked to records and vocabulary data in CollectiveAccess. These terms can also be used to enhance retrieval in searches within a CollectiveAccess system.
