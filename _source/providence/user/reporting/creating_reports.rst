Reports from Search Results
---------------------------

CollectiveAccess supports the generation of custom reports designed to help workflow and meet the needs of any collections organization. Reports can be made from records of any type in CollectiveAccess. 

There are are two ways to generate a report of multiple records:

1. **Conduct a database Search**. Use the Basic Search, Advanced Search, or Browse functions to retrieve the results that will populate your report. 
2. **Create a Set**. Select a Set name under "Search by Set" in the left-side menu of the Search screen and select Search. This will populate your search results with the items from the chosen Set.

In any display configuration, there are several format options for downloading and printing search results and sets. These include: 

* Tab delimited files
* Comma Delimited files (CSV)
* Printable PDFs (checklist or thumbnails)
* Word processing files (DOCX)
* An Excel spreadsheet (XLSX) 

Export Tools
------------

Generating a report can be done by conducting a database search. For example, a report for a single object can be made from a search result(s).

Conduct a search in the databse. When results are pulled, an option exists to the right by hovering over the download icon |export| labelled Export Tools.

Reports from a Set

Once the Set is created, navigate to the **Items** screen to add records to the Set.
