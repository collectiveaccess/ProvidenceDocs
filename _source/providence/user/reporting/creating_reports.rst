Reports from Search Results
---------------------------

CollectiveAccess supports the generation of custom reports designed to help workflow and meet the needs of any collections organization. Reports can be made from records of any type in CollectiveAccess. 

There are are two ways to generate a report of multiple records:

1. **Conduct a database Search**. Use the Basic Search, Advanced Search, or Browse functions to retrieve the results that will populate your report. 
2. **Create a Set**. Select a Set name under "Search by Set" in the left-side menu of the Search screen and select Search. This will populate your search results with the items from the chosen Set.

In any display configuration, there are several format options for downloading and printing search results and sets. These include: 

* Tab delimited files
* Comma Delimited files (CSV)
* Printable PDFs (checklist or thumbnails)
* Word processing files (DOCX)
* An Excel spreadsheet (XLSX) 

Download Media for Reports
--------------------------

The Download Media dropdown within Export Tools allows media in various sizes to be pulled from all, or selected, results.
Media can also be downloaded from the media tab of an individual record by selecting the download icon. 

Reports of a Single Record
--------------------------

To create a report of a single record, print a display from the Summary screen. Simply choose a preconfigured display from the drop-down list on the Summary screen of any record. In order to print, select the white page icon to the right of the drop-down. A new window will open, containing a printer-friendly PDF of the summary.
