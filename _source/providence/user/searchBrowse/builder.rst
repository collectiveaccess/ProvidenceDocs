Search Builder
=====================
**Search Builder** is a method of generating advanced and specific searches within records in CollectiveAccess. The search builder screen contains a full list of all metadata elements used in a specific CollectiveAccess system, which can be selected, with different options to further narrow the search within that metadata element. Search Builder is an ideal tool for searches that will be used to generate custom reports or checklists, as what elements are included or excluded can be completely customized.
