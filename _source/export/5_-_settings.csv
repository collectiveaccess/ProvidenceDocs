table,Sets the table for the exported data,Corresponds to CollectiveAccess Basic Tables,ca_objects
wrap_before,"If this exporter is used for an item set export (as opposed to a single item), the text set here will be inserted before the first item. This can for instance be used to wrap a repeating set of XML elements in a single global element. The text should be valid for the current exporter format.",Arbitrary string value,"<rdf:RDF xmlns:dc=""http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/"" ...>"
wrap_after,"If this exporter is used for an item set export (as opposed to a single item), the text set here will be inserted after the last item. This can for instance be used to wrap a repeating set of XML elements in a single global element. The text has to be valid for the current exporter format.",Arbitrary string value,</rdf:RDF>
wrap_before_record,Same as wrap_before but only applies to single item/record exports.,Arbitrary string value,"<mySingleRecordWrap xml:id=""fooBar"">"
wrap_after_record,Same as wrap_after but only applies to single item/record exports.,Arbitrary string value,</mySingleRecordWrap>
typeRestrictions,"If set, this mapping will only be available for these types. Multiple types are separated by commas or semicolons. Note that this doesn't work very well for batch exports because search results or sets typically consist of records of multiple types. The exporter select dropdown always shows all exporters for that table, but when you actually run the export in batch mode, it will filter according to the restriction, which can get a little confusing when you look at the result.",comma- or semi-colon separated list of valid type codes for this table,"image,document"
MARC_outputFormat,MARC supports a couple of different output formats for the same kinds of mapping. Set the format you want to use here. Default is 'readable'. See [2] for more details,"readable', 'raw' or 'xml'. readable refers to the typical more or less human-readable table-like format used for MARC records. raw is used to write MARC binary files for data exchange. The 3rd option uses MARCXML as output format.",xml
