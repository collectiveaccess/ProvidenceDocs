If not set, the system/user default is used.",Valid locale code,de_DEcontext,"This is used to switch the context for this mapping item (and all hierarchy children) to a different record (usually a set of records). A basic application of this feature is to create a kind of sub-export inside the mapping where you can pull in data from related items or hierarchical descendants. Once the context is switched, the 'source' values for this row and all children are relative to the new context, unless of course it is switched again (you can build cascades). This allows you, for instance, to list all works of the creator of a painting which you're exporting. The context-switched mapping item is always repeated for each record selected by the context switch! See also the 'restrictToTypes', 'restrictToRelationshipTypes' and 'checkAccess' settings to further specify the Note that if the context is switched to a related table, there are a couple of special keys available for the '''source''' column to fetch the type of the relationship between the item in the current context and the item where the context was last switched. These keys are: '''relationship_type_id''', '''relationship_type_code''' and '''relationship_typename'''. It is also possible to switch context to an attribute of the current record. This helps properly process repeatable containers as encapsuled sub-exports. If the context is switched to a container like ca_entities.address, all elements of the container are available in the source column for all child mappings. They are addressed by only their code(e.g. ""city"").
