Option,Description,Notes,Example
delimiter,Delimiter to split repeating values on.  ,,"{""delimiter"": "";""}"
hierarchicalDelimiter,"Delimiter to use when formatting hierarchical paths. This option is only supported by sources that have a notion of related data and relationship types, most notably (and for now only) the CollectiveAccessDataReader.",,"{""hierarchicalDelimiter: "" ➜ ""}"
formatWithTemplate,,,
applyRegularExpressions,"Rewrite source data using a list of Perl compatible regular expressions as supported in the PHP programming language. Each item in the list is an entry with two keys: ""match"" (the regular expression) and ""replaceWith"" (a replacement value for matches). ""replaceWith"" may include numbered back references in the form \\n where n is the index of the regular expression parenthetical match group.  ",,"{
   ""applyRegularExpressions"": [
       {
           ""match"": ""([0-9]+)\\.([0-9]+)"",
            ""replaceWith"": ""\\1:\\2""
       },
        {
           ""match"": ""[^0-9:]+"",
           ""replaceWith"": """"
       }
    ]
}"
prefix,Text to prepend to value prior to import.,,
suffix,Text to append to value prior to import.,,
default,Value to use if data source value is empty.,,
restrictToTypes,Restricts the the mapping to only records of the designated type.  For example the Duration field is only applicable to objects of the type moving_image and not photograph.,,
filterToTypes,"Restricts the mapping to pull only records related with the designated types from the source. This option is only supported by sources that have a notion of related data and types, most notably (and for now only) the CollectiveAccessDataReader.",,
filterToRelationshipTypes,"Restricts the mapping to pull only records related with the designated relationship types from the source. This option is only supported by sources that have a notion of related data and relationship types, most notably (and for now only) the CollectiveAccessDataReader.",,
skipIfEmpty,Skip the mapping If the corresponding data value is empty.,,"{""skipIfEmpty"": 1}"
skipRowIfEmpty,,,
skipGroupIfEmpty,,,
skipIfValue,,,
skipRowIfValue,,,
skipGroupIfValue,,,
skipIfNotValue,,,
skipRowIfNotValue,,,
skipGroupIfNotValue,,,
skipIfExpression,"Skip mapping if expression evaluates to true. All data in the current row is available during expression evaluation. By default,  data is the ""raw"" and source data. To use data rewritten by replacement values and applyRegularExpressions in your expression evaluation, set the _useRawValuesWhenTestingExpression_ to false.",,"{""skipIfExpression"": ""^14 =~ /kitten/""}"
skipRowIfExpression,Skip data row if expression evaluates to true. Data available during evaluation is subject to the same rules as in _skipIfExpression_.,,"{""skipRowIfExpression"": ""wc(^14) > 10""}"
skipGroupIfExpression,,,
skipIfDataPresent,,,
skipIfNoReplacementValue,Skip mapping if the value does not have a replacement value defined,Available from version 1.7.9,
useRawValuesWhenTestingExpression,"Determines whether data used during evaluation of expressions in _skipIfExpression_ and _skipRowIfExpression_ is raw, unaltered source data and data transformed using any replacement values and/or regular expressions defined for the mapping. The default value is true. Set to false to use transformed data. (Available from version 1.7.9)",,"{""useRawValuesWhenTestingExpression"": false}"
maxLength,Truncate to specified length if value exceeds that length.,,
relationshipType,Relationship type to use when linking to a related record.,,
convertNewlinesToHTML,Convert newline characters in text to HTML &lt;BR/&gt; tags.,,
collapseSpaces,Convert multiple spaces to a single space.,,
useAsSingleValue,Force repeating values to be imported as a single value concatenated with the specified delimiter.,,
matchOn,"List indicating sequence of checks for an existing record; values of array can be ""label"" and ""idno"". Ex. array(""idno"", ""label"") will first try to match on idno and then label if the first match fails.",,
truncateLongLabels,Truncate preferred and non-preferred labels that exceed the maximum length to fit.,,
lookahead,Number of rows ahead of the current row to pull value from.,,
useParentAsSubject,Import parent of subject instead of subject. This option is primarily useful when you are using a hierarchy builder refinery mapped to parent_id to create the entire hierarchy (including subject) and want the bottom-most level of the hierarchy to be the subject.,,
treatAsIdentifiersForMultipleRows,Explode value on delimiter and use as identifiers for multiple rows.,,
displaynameFormat,"Transform label using options for formatting entity display names. Default is to use value as is. Other options are surnameCommaForename, forenameCommaSurname, forenameSurname. See DataMigrationUtils::splitEntityName().",,
mediaPrefix,Path to import directory containing files references for media or file metadata attributes.,,
matchType,"Determines how file names are compared to the match value. Valid values are STARTS, ENDS, CONTAINS and EXACT. (Default is EXACT)",,
matchMode,"Determines whether to search on file names, enclosing directory names or both. Valid values are DIRECTORY_NAME, FILE_AND_DIRECTORY_NAMES and FILE_NAME. (Default is FILE_NAME).",,
errorPolicy,"Determines how errors are handled for the mapping.  Options are to ignore the error, stop the import when an error is encountered and to receive a prompt when the error is encountered.",,
