code,Give your mapping an alphanumeric code of the mapping,"Arbitrary text, with no special characters or spaces",my_sample_mapping
inputFormats,Sets type of source (input) data that can be handled by this import mapping. Values are format codes defined by the various DataReader plugins.,file type,XLSX
table,"Sets the table for the imported data. If you are importing Objects, set the table to ca_objects. If you are importing Collections, set this to ca_collections, and so on.",Corresponds to the CollectiveAccess basic tables,ca_objects
type,"Set the Type of record to set all imported records to. If you are importing Objects, what type are they? Photographs, Artifacts, Paintings, etc. This value needs to correspond to an existing value in the the types list. For objects, the list isobject_types. If the import includes a mapping to type_id, that will be privileged and the type setting will be ignored.",CollectiveAccess list item code,image
numInitialRowsToSkip,The number of rows at the top of the data set to skip. Use this setting to skip over column headers in spreadsheets and similar data.,numeric value,1
existingRecordPolicy,"Determines how existing records in the CollectiveAccess system are checked for and handled for the mapping. Also determines how records created by the mapping are merged with other instances (idno and/or preferred label) in the data source. 

(In CollectiveAccess, the primary ID field is ""idno"" and the title/name field of each record is ""preferred_label"".)

From version 1.8 options to skip, merge or overwrite on internal CollectiveAccess record ids is also supported via
the \*_on_id options. These options can be useful when re-importing data previously exported from a CollectiveAccess instance.
