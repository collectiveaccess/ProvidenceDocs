Server Requirements,NotesOperating System,"Linux, Windows (Server 2003, Server 2008, Server 2012, Windows XP and Windows 7, Windows 8 verified to work), Solaris 9+, Mac OS X 10.5+. See the operating system specific notes for additional information on specific operating systems"Server Memory,"For typical uses and small media (eg. 10 meg TIFF images or 2 meg JPEG images) 1gig of RAM is usually adequate to ensure reasonable performance. If you intend to have CA handle large image image files then your server should ideally have three times the size of the largest image when uncompressed. If you don't have this much memory media processing still work, but will be much slower for large files. Processing of video and audio is much less memory intensive but can still benefit from additional memory when present. In general more memory is always better, and 4gigs of RAM is a good baseline assuming it is not cost prohibitive or otherwise impractical."Data Storage,"This is largely project dependent. Collections with quantities of high-quality video, for example, can quickly use up hundreds of gigabytes of storage while lower-resolution image catalogues may require only a few megabytes of space. A simple formula for estimating storage requirements requires an expected number of media items to be catalogued and an average size for those media items. Once these quantities are known an estimate can be derived using some simple arithmetic: <storage required in mb> = (<# of media items> * <average storage requirements per media item in mb>) + (<# of media items> * 5mb). 5mb is estimated overhead of storing derivatives (small JPEG, TilePic pan-and-zoom version, etc.); if is often lower but shouldn't exceed this unless you're storing truly huge images or change the standard media processing configuration. Unless cost-ineffective, it is recommended to double the calculated storage requirements when acquiring hardware. Storage requirements for your metadata and database indices, even if your database is quite large, are usually negligible compared to the storage required for media."Processor,"Any modern CPU should provide adequate performance. Multiprocessor/multicore architectures are desirable for the improved scalability they provide, and well as the capability to speed the processing of uploaded media. Media processing is often CPU-bound (as opposed to database operations which are often I/O bound) and lends itself to multiprocessing. It is advisable to to obtain at least a 2-way and, if possible, 4-way machine. The extra processor cores are usually not an expensive add-on and often prove valuable in production environments."
