Server Requirements,NotesOperating System,"Linux, Mac OS X 10.9+,  or Windows (Server 2012+, Windows 7, 8 and 10 verified to work)."Server Memory,"4 gb of RAM at minimum. If you intend to have CA handle large image files then your server should ideally have three times the size of the largest image when uncompressed. In general more memory is always better, and 8 gb of RAM is a good baseline assuming it is not cost prohibitive."Data Storage,"A simple formula for estimating storage requirements requires an expected number of media items to be catalogued and an average size for those media items. Once these quantities are known an estimate can be derived using some simple arithmetic: <storage required in mb> = (<# of media items> * <average storage requirements per media item in mb>) + (<# of media items> * 5mb). 5mb is estimated overhead of storing derivatives (small JPEG, TilePic pan-and-zoom version, etc.) Unless cost-ineffective, it is recommended to double the calculated storage requirements when acquiring hardware. Storage requirements for your metadata and database indices, even if your database is quite large, are usually negligible compared to the storage required for media."Processor,"Multiprocessor/multicore architectures are desirable for the improved scalability they provide, and well as the capability to speed the processing of uploaded media. Media processing is often CPU-bound (as opposed to database operations which are often I/O bound) and lends itself to multiprocessing. It is advisable to obtain a machine with at least a 2-cores and, if possible, 4-cores. "
