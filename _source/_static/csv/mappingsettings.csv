Setting,Description,Parameter notes,Example
name,Human readable name of the mapping,Arbitrary text,My mapping
code,Alphanumeric code of the mapping,"Arbitrary, no special characters or spaces",my_mapping
inputFormats,"Sets types of source (input) data that can be handled by this import mapping. Values are format codes defined by the various DataReader plugins. You can specify multiple formats by specifying their format codes in a semicolon delimited list. If you omit this setting then the mapping is assumed to be valid for any data type which, of course, is very unlikely.",file type,XLSX
table,Sets the table for the imported data,Corresponds to the CollectiveAccess basic tables,ca_objects
type,"Type to set all imported records to. If import includes a mapping to type_id, that will be privileged and the type setting will be ignored.",CollectiveAccess list item idno,posters
numInitialRowsToSkip,The number of rows at the top of the data set to skip. Use this setting to skip over column headers in spreadsheets and similar data.,numeric value,2
existingRecordPolicy,Determines how existing records in the CollectiveAccess system are checked for and handled for the mapping. Also determines how records created by the mapping are merged with other instances (idno and/or preferred label) in the data source.,none; skip_on_idno; merge_on_idno; overwrite_on_idno; skip_on_preferred_labels; merge_on_preferred_labels; overwrite_on_preferred_labels; skip_on_idno_and_preferred_labels; merge_on_idno_and_preferred_labels; overwrite_on_idno_and_preferred_labels; merge_on_idno_with_replace; merge_on_preferred_labels_with_replace; merge_on_idno_and_preferred_labels_with_replace,none

basePath,"For XML input formats only, basePath contains anXPath expression used to supply a set of XML nodes that are to be treated, for purposes of import, as individual records. Many XML formats require the basePath setting for data import to be possible.",XML tags,/text/body/div
environment,"Allows you to define a source expression that will be evaluated outside of basePath. Whatever value is in this source can be stored inside a variable. Then, this variable can be used as a source in the mapping itself, allowing the user to retrieve this value in a mapping that is otherwise evaluated inside of basePath.",environment | 2 | myVariable,"Any source value.

errorPolicy,"Determines how errors are handled for the import. ""Stop"" will halt the entire import on any error.",ignore; stop,ignore
locale,Set locale for all imported data. If not set the system's default locale is used.,"DEFAULT or locale code (ex. en_US, de_DE, fr_CA)",DEFAULT
