Type,Parameter,DescriptionLIST,values,"List of allowable values for the element. Used to validate input and generate a drop-down list in the user interface. Note that the value for this parameter is a simple list, not an associative list. Ex. values = [eins, zwei, drei, vier]",default,Default value for elementSERIAL,table,"database table name to use for lookup when determining next number in sequence. Should be one of the primary types (Ex. ca_objects, ca_object_lots, ca_entities, ca_places, ca_list_items)",field,"database field to use for lookup when determining next number in sequence. Should be idno for objects, idno_stub for object lots and idno for entities, places, occurrences and collections.",sort_field,database field to use for sorting lookup when determining next number in sequence,child_only,child records to automatically generate id numbers in an ascending order based on the idno of the parent record,zeropad_to_length,"if set to a non-zero value, the sequence number is left-padded with zeros until its length is equal to the value. For example, if set to 4, the sequence number 17 would be output as 0017. The zero padding length does not affect sequence numbers longer in length than the specified value. Thus, for example, if zeropad_to_length is set to 3, the sequence value 7114 would be output as-is.",sequence_by_type,"if set to a non-zero value sequences are calculated by type. That is, each individual record type within the table gets its own number sequence. By default the numbering sequence is shared amongst all types. For most primary types (objects for example) you'll generally want a single set of numbers for all types. Sometimes, most commonly for occurrences, you may prefer that each type have its own sequence. (available from v1.5)",minimum_value,"a non-zero number to use as the initial value for the sequence. Ex. if set to 20000 then the first record created with be numbered 20000, the second 20001 and so on. (available from v1.7)"CONSTANT,value,Value of constant.
