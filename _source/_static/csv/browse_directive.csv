collapse,"The facet will list entries for each distinct storage location. By default this means the each individual loan, movement, storage location or occurrence will be listed in the facet. For storage locations and occurrences this usually exactly what you want. Listing individual loans and movements, however, often results in a long list of undifferentiated values that makes effective browsing difficult. collapse' directs the browse to consolidate all records of a given type (and optionally) sub-type into a single generic facet value. In the example above, collapsing onca_loansresults in all objects for which the current location is a loan being browsable via a single ""On loan"" facet item. For movements, facet items are presented for individual movement sub-types.",No.
display,"Sets the display template used to generate the facet item for the specified type and sub-type (or in the case of storage locations, type and relationship type). Each template is generated relative to the related record.",No.
