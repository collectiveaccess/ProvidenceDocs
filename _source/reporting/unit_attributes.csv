Attribute,Description,Default,Supported
relativeTo,"Transforms the primary record of the template or enclosing <unit> (when <unit>'s are nested) to a set of related records, hierarchically related records or repeating values.",None; must be set,
restrictToTypes,"For <unit>'s relativeTo a relationship (eg. relativeTo='ca_entities') or hierarchy (eg. relativeTo='ca_objects.hierarchy', relativeTo='ca_objects.parent', relativeTo='ca_objects.siblings', relativeTo='ca_objects.children') will restrict the record set to those of the specified types. Use type identifiers and list multiple types separated by commas.",None â€“ no restriction,
restrictToRelationshipTypes,For <unit>'s relativeTo a relationship (eg. relativeTo='ca_entities') will restrict the record set to those related with the specified relationship types. Use relationship type codes and list multiple codes separated by commas.,None â€“ no restriction,
excludeTypes,"For <unit>'s relativeTo a relationship (eg. relativeTo='ca_entities') or hierarchy (eg. relativeTo='ca_objects.hierarchy', relativeTo='ca_objects.parent', relativeTo='ca_objects.siblings', relativeTo='ca_objects.children') will restrict the record set to those NOT of the specified types. Use type identifiers and list multiple types separated by commas.",None â€“ no restriction,
excludeRelationshipTypes,For <unit>'s relativeTo a relationship (eg. relativeTo='ca_entities') will restrict the record set to those related with relationship types NOT in the list. Use relationship type codes and list multiple codes separated by commas.,None â€“ no restriction,
sort,One or more bundle specifiers to sort record set on. Specifiers should be relevant to the kind of records retrieved by the relativeTo value.,None,
sortDirection,Direction of sort. Should be either ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending),ASC,
skipIfExpression,"An expression to evaluate. If true the <unit> will be skipped and no output generated. It is necessary to escape (prepend a ""\"") the surrounding quotes when using expressions.",None,
skipWhen,,,
unique,When set to a non-zero value repeat values in the unit will be removed.,FALSE,
start,"For repeating values the index of the first value to return. Indices are zero-based. Ex. to start with the second value, set start to 1.",0,
length,The maximum number of values to return. If not set all values are returned.,none,
unique,Remove duplicate values in unit using direct string comparison. If not set all values are returned.,0,
aggregateUnique,"Remove duplicate values in units by comparing individual values prior to conversion to strings. The difference between this and unique is subtle. Take, for example, a unit that formats lists of authors from several related objects. The unique option will eliminate only those lists of authors that are string-wise identical If the authors are in different orders for different objects they will be considered unique values. The aggregateUnique option considers the values used to create those lists, rather than the resulting strings. If the array of returned values for a unit, prior to conversion to a string, is the same, it is considered a duplicate no matter the order of the authors in the resulting string. Put simply, aggregateUnique applies a more aggressive de-duplication process.",0,
omitBlanks,Remove blank values from returned set. The default behavior is to include blanks. Omitting blank values is often desirable when formatting values for display.,0,Version 1.7.9
filter, , ,Version 1.7.9
filterNonPrimaryRepresentations,"For units relative to ca_object_representations, controls whether non-primary representations are displayed. Default is ""yes"" Ð non-primary representations are not displayed. Set to 0 or ""no"" to display non-primary representations.",1,
