Media_display.conf
==================
The media_display.conf file controls how media representations are displayed in both the media overlay and media editor. Display settings can be customized for images, video, video H264 original, quicktime Viewer, audio, pdf files, documents, postscript, and text.

Media Overlay and Media Editor
------------------------------
The media overlay is accessed by clicking through the representation from the Inspector in Providence. The media editor, on the other hand, is accessed by clicking through the thumbnail representation on the media editor itself. You can set the display options differently here, or configure them to be identical to the media overlay.
