Option,Description
_metadata,"Forces indexing of all metadata elements configured for the item. When indexing of all fields is desired (the typical case) use of the _metadata special field obviates the need to explicitly list all available fields, and to update indexing configuration every time a new metadata element is added."
_count,"Embeds the number of related rows for a given table in the index. You can specify this for both relationship (ex. ca_objects_x_entities) and primary (ex. ca_entities) tables. The field is named <table_name>.count *for example*: object_representations.count for table 'object_representations'. This can be used to find rows that have, or don't have, related rows in a given table.When specified on a primary table (eg. ca_entities, ca_occurrences), counts are indexed in aggregate as well as for each type. For relationship tables (eg. ca_objects_x_entities) counts are indexed in aggregate as well as for each relationship type. For example querying on a specific type or types: ca_entities.count/individual:3 (finds records with exactly three related entities of type ""individual"") ca_objects_x_entities.count/artist:[2 to 4] (finds objects with between two and four entities related as artist)"
