Facet type,Description
authority,"Authority facets allow for browsing on cataloguing applied to the browsed item from a related authority. Eg. if you want to browse for objects by place name, you'd set up a facet of type authority with options to cover the places authority."
field,Allows browsing on items using an intrinsic field. These include idno (identifier) and the handful legacy intrinsics such as ca_objects extent.
fieldList,"Allows browsing on lists that are directly related to an item via an intrinsic field. These include the type lists for each item type (eg. browse by object types), access and workflow status."
normalizedDates,"Allows browsing on date attributes where the values have been normalized, or adjusted to span periods of time. Since dates are often specific to the day (or even hour, minute and second), browsing on unmodified date data is usually undesirable. normalizedDate facets will return browse choices where dates have been collapsed into days, months, years, decades or centuries."
attribute,"Allows browsing on any simple single-value attribute. Values are presented as-is, so you should only configure browsing on metadata elements that have a relatively small range of possible values. Browsing on an attribute with narrative text content will not work well. Browsing on an attribute with typed-in text indicating materials or location may work well if data quality is relatively high."
label,Allows browsing on preferred and non-preferred labels associated with the browsed item. This can be useful for creating index-like lists of titles for a given type of item. Since the facet will list all unique label values for a type of item it is mainly useful in smaller systems with relatively few items or where records share a manageable number of labels. For larger systems with many distinct label values this facet type is likely to provide poor usability and performance.
has,"Provides a means to browse for items that either have at least one relationship to some other type of item, or for items with no relationships to a specified type of item. The option values for this facet are always ""yes"" and ""no."" This type of facet is primarily useful for retrieving objects with or without object representations (media), but it can also be used for reporting and data quality assessment purposes. For example, this facet could be configured to all retrieval of all objects without an associated entity."
dupeidno,Allows browsing for records with identifiers that are duplicated by at least one other record. Facet values are the number of repeats an identifier has. This type of facet is useful for facilitating clean up of data where identifiers have been erroneously reused. Available from version 1.7.7
location,"Allows browsing for records on current location, as defined in the current location policy configuration (current_location_criteria in app.conf)."
violations,Allows browsing for records that are in violation of rules in the metadata dictionary. (Note that the metadata dictionary is currently an undocumented feature with no configuration UI).
checkouts,Allows browsing for objects based upon checkout status set by the library check in/out module.
inHomeLocation,"Allows browsing for objects based upon whether they are currently in their home location or not, as defined in the current location policy configuration (current_location_criteria in app.conf). (Available from version 1.7.9)"
