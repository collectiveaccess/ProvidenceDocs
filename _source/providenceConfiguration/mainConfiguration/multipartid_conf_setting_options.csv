Type,Parameter,Description
LIST,values,"List of allowable values for the element. Used to validate input and generate a drop-down list in the user interface. Note that the value for this parameter is a simple list, not an associative list. Ex. values = [eins, zwei, drei, vier]"
,default,Default value for element
SERIAL,child_only,Set to restrict element for use only on records with a parent.
,zeropad_to_length,"If set to a non-zero value, the sequence number is left-padded with zeros until its length is equal to the value. For example, if set to 4, the sequence number 17 would be output as 0017. The zero padding length does not affect sequence numbers longer in length than the specified value. Thus, for example, if zeropad_to_length is set to 3, the sequence value 7114 would be output as-is."
,sequence_by_type,"For a __default__ type, if sequence_by_type is set to a non-zero value separate numeric sequences will be maintained for each type within the table. If not set (the default) a single sequence is shared across all types. For example, if the objects table is configured with types for paintings, drawings and sculptures, the default behavior would be to number all objects sequentially regardless of types (Eg. 1, 2, 3 ...). If sequence_by_type is set, then each type will be numbered sequentially, with numbers duplicating across types. (Eg. Paintings numbered 1, 2, 3 ...; drawings numbered 1, 2, 3 ...; Etc.).

You can specify the separate sequences by maintained for some, but not all, types within a table, by setting sequence_by_type on type-specific configuration entries.

From version 1.8, it is possible to specify that selected types share a single sequence by setting the sequence_by_type option to a list of types that participate in the sequence. When calculating next in sequence numbering, values from all participating types will be considered."
,dont_include_subtypes,"Controls whether sub-types are automatically included in types lists specified for the sequence_by_type option. If set, only types explicitly referenced in the setting value will be included. Default is to expand the list to include sub types. (avaialble from v1.8)"
,minimum_value,"A non-zero number to use as the initial value for the sequence. Ex. if set to 20000 then the first record created with be numbered 20000, the second 20001 and so on. (available from v1.7)"
CONSTANT,value,Value of constant. This must be specified.
FREE,minimum_length,"Minimum allowable length, in characters, of element value."
,maximum_length,"Maximum allowable length, in characters, of element value."
,zeropad_to_length,"If set to a non-zero value, the sequence number is left-padded with zeros until its length is equal to the value. For example, if set to 4, the sequence number 17 would be output as 0017. The zero padding length does not affect sequence numbers longer in length than the specified value. Thus, for example, if zeropad_to_length is set to 3, the sequence value 7114 would be output as-is."
NUMERIC,minimum_length,"Minimum allowable length, in characters, of element value."
,maximum_length,"Maximum allowable length, in characters, of element value."
,minimum_value,Minimum allowable numeric value of element value.
,maximum_value,Maximum allowable numeric value of element value.
ALPHANUMERIC,minimum_length,"Minimum allowable length, in characters, of element value."
,maximum_length,"Maximum allowable length, in characters, of element value."
YEAR,force_derived_values_to_current_year,"When deriving an identifier from an existing value (typically when duplicating a record, or creating a child record), force the new value to the current year no matter the existing value."
MONTH,force_derived_values_to_current_month,"When deriving an identifier from an existing value (typically when duplicating a record, or creating a child record), force the new value to the current month no matter the existing value."
DAY,force_derived_values_to_current_day,"When deriving an identifier from an existing value (typically when duplicating a record, or creating a child record), force the new value to the current day no matter the existing value."
