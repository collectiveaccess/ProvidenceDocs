UNSHARPEN_MASK,"
This filter sharpens an image. The image is convolved with a Gaussian operator of the
given radius and standard deviation (sigma).
For reasonable results, radius should be larger than sigma.
Use a radius of 0 to have the method select a suitable radius.

The parameters are:

* **radius**: The radius of the Gaussian, in pixels, not counting the center pixel (default 0).
* **sigma**: The standard deviation of the Gaussian, in pixels (default 1.0).
* **amount**: The fraction of the difference between the original and the blur image that is added back into the original (default 1.0).
* **threshold**: The threshold, as a fraction of QuantumRange, needed to apply the difference amount (default 0.05).
