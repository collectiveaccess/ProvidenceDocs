Top level key,Description
cache_timeout,"Number of seconds to keep information for a cached browse around before discarding. The suggested value for this key depends upon how the browse is being uses. A cached browse will not reflect changes made to the data since its creation, so for a busy backend system this value should be relative low: 300 seconds (5 minutes) is a reasonable value. For front-end systems where the catalogue data is not changing often, 86400 seconds (1 day) may be a more appropriate value. If you want to disable caching set this key to 0."
<browse_table_name>,"For each item type you wish to support browsing on you must define an associative array attached to the item table name: ca_objects, ca_entities, ca_places, ca_occurrences, ca_collections, ca_object_lots, and ca_storage_locations). The values set in each item array define the behavior of the browse for that item type. These values are defined below."
