dont_inherit_from_parent_collection,"In some archival configurations of CollectiveAccess a cross-table hierarchy is used to link object-level records to the collections they are a part of. By default these child records inherit their parent id number. This is often  desired behavior. Other times, for example when a SERIAL configuration is set for object idnos, it's not and has  potential to create duplicate id numbers. In these cases dont_inherit_from_parent_collection can be used to prevent object children from inheriting collection idnos that are duplicative. Note this only impacts cross-table hierarchies (doesn't impact other relationships or hierarchies within a single table).",dont_inherit_from_parent_collection = 1,No

allow_extra_elements,"An existing ID number value may include more elements than are currently configured. This can happen when configuration is changed, invalidating numbers created under earlier configurations, or if values are imported from other data sources that don't conform to current standards. For these numbers CollectiveAccess can either (a) ignore the additional parts, truncating the number at the configured number of parts or (b) add ""extra"" elements for these numbers, preserving the additional parts. No matter which option is chosen  a number with extra parts is still considered invalid. To tolerate numbers with extra parts set this option to a non-zero value. To truncate set this option to 0.
