Facet key,Description,Mandatory?
indefinite_article,The indefinite article to use when displaying the facet label.,Yes
multiple,"If this directive is set to 1 the facet will perform an OR browse instead of an AND browse. With ""multiple"" a user is able to select more than one value per facet, for example, in a date browse a user can find records cataloged as 1990 or 1991.",No
label_singular,"The name to display for this facet, in the singular (eg. ""place name"").",Yes
label_plural,"The name to display for this facet, in the plural (eg. ""place names"").",Yes
description,Description of the facet. This text appears on browse landing page in Pawtucket,No
group_mode,"The method by which to group facet values for display. Currently 'alphabetical', 'hierarchical' and 'none' groupings are supported. 'Alphabetical' mode groups items alphabetically by the first letter in their name; 'hierarchical' displays hierarchical facets (authorities only) in an interactive hierarchy browser; 'none' simply lists items out.",No
individual_group_display,"If set to a non-zero value, each group in the facet will be displayed separately and loaded on-demand. This can improve performance in some cases.",No
type_restrictions,"An optional list of browse item types to restrict use of this facet to. This is useful if you are restricting your browses to specific types of browse items (ex. occurrences of type ""exhibitions"" only) and want to have different facet configurations for each type-specific browse. By restricting a facet to ""exhibitions"", for example, you ensure that it will only appear when you are browsing specifically for exhibitions, or if you are performing an unrestricted browse. You can specify the restrictions are numeric type_id's or alphanumeric type codes. The latter is generally preferred as it is easier to read, understand and maintain.",No
requires,"An optional list of facet names, at least one of which must appear in the browse criteria (ie. have been used in the current browse), for the facet to be available. This is useful if you have a facet that is only relevant in the context of a selection limited by another facet. For example, if you have a facet defined for countries and another for state/provinces, you can ensure that the state/province facet is only made available to the user if a country has already been selected for the browse by making state/providence ""require"" the country facet.",No
single_value,"If set to a valid facet value, then selecting the facet will browse on the specified value rather than opening up a browse facet display with choices. This option can be useful for facets with one or two values, where explicit links are preferred over a list interface.",No
facet_groups,"A list of tags (""groups"") to apply to the facet. Facets displayed by the browse engine can be limited using these tags, via the browse engine setFacetGroup() method. Facet groups are mainly useful when you need to have distinct sets of facets display in different contexts.",No
relative_to,"Browse facets are typically generated relative to the table being browsed. If you are browsing objects, for example, a facet of related entities will display names of entities related directly to objects. relative_to, when set to a table other than the table being browsed, enables you to generate facets with values from a table related to the one you are browsing. You could, for example, generate a facet of birth dates of entities related to objects, or a list of places related to entities related to objects. In effect this is an indirect browse. Even though the facet values are related to the relative_to table, the results of the browse are still the same. relative_to can be very useful when metadata you want to browse by is actually related to a table different than the one you wish to get results for. Value must be a valid item table name (Eg. ca_objects, ca_entities, ca_places, ca_occurrences, ca_collections, ca_storage_locations, ca_list_item, Etc.)",No
access,"A list of access values to restrict facet visibility to. Access values are numerical values used to control public visibility of records. Each user, authenticated or not, while be associated with one or more access values. For non-authenticated users access values will be those specified in the public_access_settings directive in app.conf. For authenticated users it will be a list of values conferred by the users associated roles. Any user having any of the access values for the facet will be able to use the facet. If this option is omitted or left empty no restriction will be applied. Available from version 1.7.7",No
roles,A list of user role code to restrict facet visibility to. Any user having any of the roles listed for the facet will be able to use the facet. If this option is omitted or left empty no restriction will be applied. Available from version 1.7.7,No
