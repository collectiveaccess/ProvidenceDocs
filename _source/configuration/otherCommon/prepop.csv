Setting name,Description,Valid values,Example
table,Defines what table the rule applies to. Required.,Any :ref:`primary table <primary_tables>`,ca_objects
restrictToTypes,Optional list of types to restrict rule to.,Any valid type for the table.,"[artwork, image]"
mode,"Required setting controlling how and if rule is applied when the target contains existing values. See flowchart below. Options are:

addIfEmpty: set value only if none already exists

overwrite: replace existing values; if the value to be set in the target is empty existing values will be removed but not replaced

overwriteifset: replace existing values only if the value to be set to a non-empty value

merge: add values that do not already exist","One of addIfEmpty, overwrite, overwriteifset, merge",addIfEmpty
target,"Specifies the metadata element that the rule will set values for. The target must be part of the record being edited. The value set is defined by the template or source directives.

Note that if when targetting a List metadata element, you must provide a valid list item idno or numeric item_id as the value.","A valid bundle specifier for either a intrinsic field, labels or an metadata element",[ca_objects.description]
template,"A display template defining the value to be set in the target. The display template is evaluated against the current record and can incorporate any value accessible to the currently edited record, including related records and hierarchical values. Required, unless the rule is targeting a container metadata element with a full copy of another container in which case ``source`` must be set.",A valid :ref:`display template <reporting/templates:Display Template Syntax>`.,^ca_objects.medium_container.medium ^ca_objects.medium_container.support
source,"Rules using ``template``  set only a single text value in the target. When prepopulating container metadata elements with values another instance of the container in a related record (Ex. replicating a container in a parent record to a child record) ``source`` may be used to specify the instance to copy from. Sub-element codes are assumed to match exactly, so on its own ``source`` is only useful for copying containers from related or hierarchical parent or child records. It is possible to selectively copy elements from different containers using source in conjunction with the ``sourceMap`` directive.. Available from version 1.8.",A valid bundle specifier for a container metadata element.,ca_objects.dimensions
sourceMap,"A dictionary mapping sub-element codes in a source container (specified by the ``source`` directive) to sub-element codes in the target container. Only values defined in the dictionary will be copied to the target. SourceMap can be used to  copy values betwen differently structured containers or, by omitting sub-elements, to selectively copy data between two instances of the same container. Available from version 1.8.",A dictionary container keys set to source container sub-element codes and values set to target sub-element codes.,"{

skipIfExpression,"An optional expression that controls if the rule is applied. The expression is evaluated relative to the currently edited record. If the result is true, the rule will not be applied for the current record.",A valid :ref:`expression <expressions>`,^ca_objects.object_status_new !~ /deaccessioned/
context,"Controls how relationships are prepopulated.  Options include

parent = copy relationships from the parent record

children = copy relationships from child records
