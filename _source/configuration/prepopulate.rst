Prepopulate.conf
================


Prepopulate is a new feature for v1.5. It allows you to automatically prepopulate fields in CollectiveAccess records based on Display Templates and Expressions.

Set Up
------

The core configuration is done in app/conf/prepopulate.conf. There are two settings that control when the prepopulate rules (more on those below) kick in: Either on record save and/or every time you open an editor (prepopulate_fields_on_save and/or prepopulate_fields_on_edit). Both are turned off by default. Set one or both of these settings to 1 to enable the feature.

The main part of the configuration is a list of rules under prepopulate_rules. Below is an example block. Each rule should have a unique code, e.g. test_rule in the block below.

.. code-block:: none

   prepopulate_rules = {
      # -------------------
      test_rule = {
         # what types of records does this rule apply to?
         table = ca_objects,
         #restrictToTypes = [artwork],

         # mode determines handling of existing values in target element
         # can be overwrite, or addIfEmpty
         # See the 'target' setting below and http://docs.collectiveaccess.org/wiki/Prepopulate
         mode = addIfEmpty,

         # What's the prepopulate target?
         # This can be an intrinsic field, labels or an attribute.
         #
         # Note that if you want to target a List attribute, you have to
         # provide a valid list item idno or id for that list as value!
         #
         # See http://docs.collectiveaccess.org/wiki/Prepopulate
         target = ca_objects.title_notes,

         # skip this rule if expression returns true
         # available variable names are bundle names
         #skipIfExpression = ^ca_objects.idno =~ /test/,

         # content to prepopulate
         # (this is a display template evaluated against the current record)
         template = ^ca_objects.preferred_labels (^ca_objects.idno),
      },
	  # -------------------
   }

Below is a short description for each of the rule settings

.. csv-table::
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1
   :file: ../_static/csv/prepopulate.csv

Example use of "context" configuration:

.. code-block:: none

   related_entities = {
      table = ca_objects,

      # add relationships that do not already exist
      mode = merge,

      # copy all entities related to objects related to the target record
      target = ca_entities,
      context = related,

      # copy only those entities related with the relationship type "artist"
      restrictToRelationshipTypes = [artist],

      # don't copy relationships with specified relationship type codes;
      #excludeRelationshipTypes = [],

      # copy only entities that are the type "individual"
      restrictToRelatedTypes = [ind],

      # don't copy relationships pointing to specified types
      #excludeRelatedTypes = [],

      # only consider "current" relationships â€“ Eg. current storage location
      currentOnly = 0,
   }
