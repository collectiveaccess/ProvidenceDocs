CollectiveAccess Setup and Use
==============================


CollectiveAccess is open-source collections management and presentation software designed for museums, archives, and special collections also increasingly used by libraries, corporations and non-profits. It is designed to handle large, heterogeneous collections that have complex cataloguing requirements and require support for a variety of metadata standards and media formats. CollectiveAccess is a collaboration between Whirl-i-Gig and partner institutions in North America and Europe with projects in 5 continents. The software is freely available under the open source GNU General Public License, meaning itâ€™s not only free to download and use but that users are encouraged to share and distribute code.
