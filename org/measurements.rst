Measurement input formats
=========================

Quantities entered into a measurement attribute must include both a numeric quantity and a trailing unit specifier. For example, when entering a length, it is not enough to simply enter "10"; you must also specify whether the quantity is in inches, feet, meters or some other unit of measurement. The unit specification always comes after the quantity. For example: 10.5 meters; 4"; 55km; 10lbs; 25.5kg; 25 1/3 in; 5 ¾ feet; 1½ cm.

Note that you can use decimal as well as two forms of fractional notation: simple text "division" (ex. 3/4) or Unicode fraction glyphs (ex. ¾)
